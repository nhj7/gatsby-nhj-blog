작년에 GAIQ를 취득했었는데 올해 다시 취득해야할 시간이 얼마 남지 않은듯 하다. 약 3달 남짓. GAIQ는 문제 은행식으로 제출되므로 미리 문제들을 한번씩 읽고 풀면 쉽게 풀 수 있다. 문제는 70문제이며 그 중 56문제 이상을 맞추면 통과할 수 있다. 

<figure class="imageblock alignCenter"><span data-url="https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/b1xwHV/btqyghpzURc/sKGpNLYOQb72yMoVJSIHyK/img.png" data-lightbox="lightbox" data-alt="GAIQ"><img src="https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/b1xwHV/btqyghpzURc/sKGpNLYOQb72yMoVJSIHyK/img.png" srcset="https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&amp;fname=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.kakaocdn.net%2Fdn%2Fb1xwHV%2FbtqyghpzURc%2FsKGpNLYOQb72yMoVJSIHyK%2Fimg.png"></span><figcaption>GAIQ</figcaption></figure>

대략 300문제 가량 되는것 같으니 이정도만 숙지해도 시험 보는데는 지장없을 것 같다. 여러 출처의 문제은행을 다시 합친거라 중복이 있을 수 있으나 정답은 같을 거다. 

문제를 모으고 나름 제목에 강조, 정답에 음영을 넣는 수기 작업을 거친 노가다의 산물이다....
